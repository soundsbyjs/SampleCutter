# Sample Cutter is a little tool I made for feature extraction

The purpose of this tool is to create a set of audio files out of one audio file.
This is so that you can do a long bout of sound design and then cut each sound down into a single file, or you can create AI datasets inside your DAW and then use them for feature extraction!

usage:

1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. python3 samplecutter "one long audio file" [options]
